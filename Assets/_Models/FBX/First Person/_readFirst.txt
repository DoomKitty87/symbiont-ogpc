These files are only used for animation importing, and copy their avatar definition from the base 
fpsArms.blend file.

DO NOT DELETE OR CHANGE THE FPSARMS.BLEND FILE! THAT WILL CAUSE ISSUES AND I DO NOT WANT TO SOLVE THEM

To make new animations:

1: Open up the fpsArms.blend file and add the gun mesh you're animating to it,
then save it as a copy.

2: Make your animations, then export them as an FBX file with only Armatures and Meshes selected,
and make sure all of the options under "Bake Animation" are checked.

3: Export the FBX file to the FBX folder under the Blender folder, and set the import settings to
copy the avatar definition of the base fpsArms.blend file.

4: Copy the animations included in the FBX file to the Animations/Player in a new folder.

5: Copy the _template animation override in the Weapons/Animations and fill in the animations as needed.

6: Assign the animation override to a weapon item 

7: Done!
